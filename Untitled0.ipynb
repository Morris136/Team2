Dangerous tasks:\n","   - Mining, nuclear maintenance, deep sea or space exploration\n","   - Military use (e.g., drones)\n","\n","3.

Emotional intelligence and human interaction:\n","   - Counseling, social work, education\n","   - Nursing and elder care that require empathy and real-time decisions\n","\n","2.
